Nowadays, with the growing ubiquitous nature of Internet Technology, young people are more than ever employing its usage in various aspects of their daily lives.  This is especially true for finding services and facilitating social gatherings/interactions.  This trend is the inspiration for our project.  We are proposing a web application that can be used to bring together users who desire a meal in a specific area so they don’t have to eat alone; similar to Tinder except the emphasis is on food rather than “romance”.  

The main idea that holds the concept of our web application together is the ability to create and join groups.  Based on his/her preferences (price range, cuisine, desired group number, location, etc), a user will be able to use our grouping system to find other users in the area who are in the mood for similar restaraunts and have a compatible schedule.  We currently have five entities:  User, Restaurant, Area, Proposal, Group, Reservations.  Users will have the attributes uid, email, and phone number and be related to proposals through the “proposed” relationship set.  A proposal will represent the indication  that a user wants to find a group to eat with.  This entity’s attributes are: time range, cuisine, price range, and ideal group size.  Proposals will be related to the groups through the relationship set “matched” and the groups’ attributes will be size and time.  Both proposals and groups will be related to restaurants by the relationship sets “at’ and “placed for” respectively, with the former being an optional relation.   We will probably use restaurant data from yelp and foursquare to populate the database.
